- Adjusted tests for the 'next' and 'previous' methods to avoid actually exceeding the year boundaries.

- Added support for countries where the weekend definition (start and end day) differs from the global definition (Saturday and Sunday).

- Corrected reference to the Holiday Provider's ID to be static.
- Changed weekend data property into constant as it is not dynamic (runtime).

- Holiday Provider for Lithuania. [\#67](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/67) ([lukosius](https://github.com/lukosius))
- Sometimes it is more convenient to be able to create a Yasumi instance by ISO3166 code rather than Yasumi's Holiday Provider name. A new function `createByISO3166_2` has been added to allow for that. [\#62](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/62) ([huehnerhose](https://github.com/huehnerhose))
- Missing translations (de_DE) for Easter Sunday and Whitsunday. [\#60](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/60) ([IceShack](https://github.com/IceShack))

- All Saints Day for Finland was incorrectly set for November 1st. The correct date is Saturday between 31 Oct and 6 Nov, similar to Sweden. [\#43](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/issues/43) ([stelgenhof](https://github.com/stelgenhof))


## [1.4.0] - 2016-06-04

### Changed
- All Holiday Provider must now implement a code that will identify it. Typically this is the ISO3166 code
  corresponding to the respective country or sub-region. This can help for purposes such as translations or interfacing
  with other API's for example.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with the unit test for the 'getProviders' method failing on Windows. Hardcoded unix-style directory separators have been replaced by DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR. [\#30](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/30) ([navarr](https://github.com/navarr))
- Corrected a typo in the English translation for 敬老の日 (Japan) [\#22](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/22) ([navarr](https://github.com/navarr))

  been celebrated on a Saturday (between October 31 and November 6th).
- Fixed the getProviders as it was not able to load Holiday Providers defined in (sub) regions [\#5879133](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/commit/58791330ccf5c13b1626885921534c32866b7faf) ([R2c](https://github.com/R2c))

- Fixed issue for France as Good Friday and St. Stephens Day were defined as official holidays. These aren't national
  holidays and are only observed in the French departments Moselle, Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin. With this fix, these
  holidays have been removed from the France Holiday providers and new providers for the departments Moselle, Bas-Rhin
  and Haut-Rhin are added. [\#17](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/issues/17) ([R2c](https://github.com/R2c))

  holiday has always been celebrated on a Saturday (between June 20 and June 26).
- Fixed base test for some Spain/LaRioja as some holidays have been established only in a particular year, causing
  false failures in the unit tests.
- Running php-cs-fixer fix . --level=psr2 generated a massive list of changes, and broke unit tests. Added a custom
  .php_cs config file to adhere to the PSR-2 Coding Standards and resolve this issue. In addition the php-cs-fixer
  command to has been added to composer to run the fixers and on the CI server (Travis), meaning PR’s will need to be
  PSR2 compliant before they can be merged. If any files do not pass, the build fails. [\#15](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/issues/15) [\#16](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/16) ([badams](https://github.com/badams))
- Accidentally the timezone for Norway was set to "Europe/Copenhagen". This has been corrected to "Europe/Oslo". [\#11](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/issues/11) [\#12](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/12) ([badams](https://github.com/badams))
