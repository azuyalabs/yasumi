***!!Update!!***
A new [blog](https://azuyalabs.github.io/yasumi/blog/) section has been added to the documentation site. Keeping you informed about any news, releases, etc. in a handy blog post format!

Yasumi (Japanese for 'Holiday'「休み」) is an easy PHP library to help you calculate the dates and names of holidays and other
special celebrations from various countries/states. Many services exist on the internet that provide holidays, however
are either not free or offer only limited information. In addition, no complete PHP library seems to exist today
that covers a wide range of holidays and countries, except maybe [PEAR's Date_Holidays](https://pear.php.net/package/Date_Holidays) which unfortunately hasn't been updated for a long time.

The goal of Yasumi is to be powerful while remaining lightweight, by utilizing PHP native classes wherever possible.
Yasumi's calculation is provider-based (i.e. by country/state) so it's easy to add new holiday providers that calculate
holidays. The methods of Yasumi can be used to get a holiday's date and name in various languages.
