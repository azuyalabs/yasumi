# Introduction

Yasumi (Japanese for 'Holiday'「休み」) is the easy PHP library that helps you retrieve the dates and names of holidays and
other special celebrations from various countries/states. It is calculation and rule driven avoiding the need of a
comprehensive database.

Many services exist that can provide holiday information, however are either not entirely free or only offer limited
information. In addition, no exhaustive PHP library exists today covering a wide range of holidays and
countries. [PEAR's Date_Holidays](https://pear.php.net/package/Date_Holidays) library was a similar attempt, however it
hasn't been updated for a long time.

# Highlights

The goal of Yasumi is to be powerful while remaining lightweight, by utilizing PHP native classes wherever possible.
Yasumi's calculation is provider-based (i.e. by country/state), making it easy to add new holiday providers that
calculate holidays.

- Straightforward API
- Framework-agnostic
- Use of Providers to easily extend and expand new Holidays
- Common Holiday Providers
- Accounts for the date/time when holidays have been officially established and/or abolished
- Filters enabling to easily select certain holiday types (Official, Observed, Bank, Seasonal or Other)
- Global Translations
- Timezone aware
- Implements [ArrayIterator](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.arrayiterator.php) to easily process a provider's
  holidays
- Fully documented
- Fully unit tested
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) ready, [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)
  and [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) compliant
