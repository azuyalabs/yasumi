Yasumi
==========

Yasumi (Japanese for 'Holiday'「休み」) is an easy PHP library to help you calculate the dates and names of holidays and other
special celebrations from various countries/states. Many services exist on the internet that provide holidays, however
are either not free or offer only limited information. In addition, no complete PHP library seems to exist today
that covers a wide range of holidays and countries, except maybe [PEAR's Date_Holidays](https://pear.php.net/package/Date_Holidays)
which unfortunately hasn't been updated for a long time.

The goal of Yasumi is to be powerful while remaining lightweight, by utilizing PHP native classes wherever possible.
Yasumi's calculation is provider-based (i.e. by country/state) sos easy to add new holiday providers that calculate
holidays. The methods of Yasumi can be used to get a holiday's date and name in various languages.

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Yasumi\Filters\OfficialHolidaysFilter;
use Yasumi\Yasumi;

$holidays = Yasumi::create('USA', 2016);

// Get the number of defined holidays
echo $holidays->count() . PHP_EOL;

// 2016-07-05
```


Testing<a name="testing"></a>
-------

Yasumi has a [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) test suite. To run the tests, run the following command from the project
folder:

``` bash
$ phpunit
```

Yasumi has over 1500 unit tests with multiple iterations of assertions. Since Yasumi is using randomized years for asserting
the holidays, multiple iterations of assertions are executed to ensure the holidays are calculated in a large number
of years.

The tests are organized in some test suites to make testing a bit more easier:

* "Base"          : For testing the base functionality of Yasumi
* "Australia"     : For separately testing the Australia Holiday Provider
* "Austria"       : For separately testing the Austria Holiday Provider
