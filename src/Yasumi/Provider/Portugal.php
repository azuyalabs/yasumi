     * The Carnation Revolution (Portuguese: Revolução dos Cravos), also referred to as the 25 April (Portuguese: 25 de
     * Abril), was initially a military coup in Lisbon, Portugal, on 25 April 1974 which overthrew the regime of the
     * Estado Novo. The revolution started as a military coup organized by the Armed Forces Movement (Portuguese:
     * Movimento das Forças Armadas, MFA) composed of military officers who opposed the regime, but the movement was
     * soon coupled with an unanticipated and popular campaign of civil resistance. This movement would lead to the
     * fall of the Estado Novo and the withdrawal of Portugal from its African colonies and East Timor. The name
     * "Carnation Revolution" comes from the fact that almost no shots were fired and when the population took to the
     * streets to celebrate the end of the dictatorship and war in the colonies, carnations were put into the muzzles
     * of rifles and on the uniforms of the army men. In Portugal, the 25th of April is a national holiday, known as
     * Freedom Day (Portuguese: Dia da Liberdade), to celebrate the event.

     * was the name given by nineteenth-century 'romantic' historians to the war between Portugal and Spain that began
     * with the Portuguese revolution of 1640 and ended with the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668. The revolution of 1640 ended
     * the 60-year rule of Portugal by the Spanish Habsburgs. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic
     * skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned
     * by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with non-Iberian powers. Spain was involved in the Thirty Years' War
     * until 1648 and the Franco–Spanish War until 1659, while Portugal was involved in the Dutch–Portuguese War until
     * 1663. In the seventeenth century and afterwards, this period of sporadic conflict was simply known, in Portugal
     * and elsewhere, as the Acclamation War. The war established the House of Braganza as Portugal's new ruling
     * dynasty, replacing the House of Habsburg. This ended the so-called Iberian Union.
