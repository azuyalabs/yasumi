     * November 1 and in many eastern churches it is celebrated on the first Sunday after Pentecost. It is also known

     * churches. In the Lutheran churches, such as the Church of Sweden, it assumes a role of general commemoration of
     * the dead. In the Swedish and Finnish calendar, the observance takes place on the Saturday between 31 October and
     * 6 November. In many Lutheran Churches, it is moved to the first Sunday of November.
